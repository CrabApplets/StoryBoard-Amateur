Basic Camera Shots,Angle of view,"Shots are usually defined by how much of the scene you show in your frame (what you see in your viewfinder). This can be controlled a couple of different ways.  One would be to change the distance between the camera and your subject by physically moving the camera closer or farther away. The other would be to change the focal length of your lens, which controls the angle of view. A zoom lens, which virtually all camcorders have, is a combination wide angle, normal and telephoto lens. You change the angle of view by zooming in to a narrow angle of view (telephoto) or zooming out to a wide angle of view.",Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Close-up,"A close-up focuses your viewer's attention on specific details. It demands that the viewer concentrate on the information you are giving them. In storytelling, close-ups have great emotional impact.  They can also be used to give the audience information the characters in your video don't have. For example, showing a close-up of a sign reading 'wet paint', right before a medium shot of your character in the process of sitting down on a painted park bench, would build anticipation and set up the audience for the laugh. 
You will most likely need to use a camera support, like a tripod, in order to get a steady shot. Check out the camera-handling section. 

A close-up of a person would frame the subject from the top of the head to the top of the shoulders. Human emotions are best revealed in close-ups!",Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Close-up of faces,A close-up of a person would frame the subject from the top of the head to the top of the shoulders. Human emotions are best revealed in close-ups!,Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Establishing Shot,Long shots are also referred to as wide shots or establishing shots. An establishing shot establishes the subject's location for your viewers by revealing its surrounding. It might also be used to cover broad action involving several people in a large area.,Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Extreme close-up,"An extreme close-up shot frames only a portion of your subject. It is a very dramatic shot that can generate great visual excitement.  XCUs might be used to show the face of a wristwatch or words being typed on a computer screen. Like the long shot, extreme close-ups should be used sparingly, when it is important that your viewers see great detail. In most instances you'll want to choose a wide-angle lens setting (zoomed all the way out) and move the camera lens as close to the subject as necessary. Use of a camera support, like a tripod, is a must. Check out the camera-handling section.

An extreme close-up of a person's face would detail the eyes, nose and mouth.  When framing an extreme close-up of a face, be sure to include the chin and sacrifice the forehead. The reason for this has to do with how our imaginations fill in spaces we can't actually see on the screen, using something called psychological closure. When framing human subjects, proper closure can be achieved by avoiding putting natural cutoff lines of persons at the bottom of your frame. Instead, frame your shots to include the area slightly above or below these natural body joints. Your shot will look awkward if you don't supply enough visual information for your viewers to project what lies outside the frame. 

Television has been described as a close-up medium.  That's because most TV sets have a diagonal measurement of 32 inches or less.  Images that appear small on the screen get lost.  Shoot mostly medium shots, with a generous supply of close-ups to keep the audience engaged.",Edit Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Long Shot,"A long shot frames a wide field of view of your subject and its surroundings. It usually requires a greater distance between your camera and your subject. Most likely you would choose a wide-angle lens setting (zoomed out). 

Long shots are also referred to as wide shots or establishing shots. An establishing shot establishes the subject's location for your viewers by revealing its surrounding. It might also be used to cover broad action involving several people in a large area. 

Use long shots sparingly!  Details are lost in long shots. Overuse of long shots is boring.",Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Medium Shot,"A medium shot frames more of your subject while still revealing some of the background. If your subject is a person, a medium shot would show the person from about the waist up. 

Medium shots provide more detail than long shots, which makes them more interesting to your viewer.

Basic Camera Shots,Natural cutoff lines,"When framing shots of people, don't forget to avoid placing the edge of your frame at one of the body's natural cutoff lines: neck, elbows, waist, knees and ankles.",Edit Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Zooming In,You change the angle of view by zooming in to a narrow angle of view (telephoto)  See 'close-up',Film Tip
Basic Camera Shots,Zooming Out,Zooming out to a wide angle of view.  See 'Long Shot'.,Film Tip
Visual Composition rules,Distracting Backgrounds,"Most of your shots will include background elements that are part of the location where you're shooting.  Make sure what's in the background of your shot doesn't draw your viewer's attention from your main subject. We've all seen live TV interviews, shot on location, where somebody in the background is waving or making faces at the camera.  This is one type of distracting background you need to try to avoid.  Always check what's in the background of the shot you are framing.  Background clutter or distracting objects, like an overflowing garbage bin, can usually be avoided by repositioning your camera  (moving it left or right, framing a tighter shot, changing the camera angle) or moving your subject. You might also be able to put the background out of focus by decreasing the depth of field in your shot. See the screen depth section for more information on controlling depth of field.",Film Tip
Visual Composition rules,Headroom,"Headroom refers to the amount of space between the top of a person's head and the top of your frame. Too much headroom makes the person appear to be sinking. Most novice photographers and videographers will frame shots of people with too much headroom. Take a look through some old family photos if you don't believe me.

Too little headroom places visual emphasis on the person's chin and neck. When framing shots of people, pay attention to where the eyes appear.  Follow the rule of thirds and place the subject's eyes on the upper third line, 

Reminder: When framing shots of people, don't forget to avoid placing the edge of your frame at one of the body's natural cutoff lines: neck, elbows, waist, knees and ankles.",Edit Tip
Visual Composition rules,Lead Space,"Lead space refers to space in front of your subject. Leave extra space in the direction your subject is looking. You might also see this space referred to as look space or nose room. Leave extra space in front of a moving person or object, like a runner, bicycle, or automobile when following the action. Not doing so will make it look like your subject is in danger of running into the edge of your frame!",Film Tip
Visual Composition rules,Mergers,"Mergers are another form of distracting background.  Background objects or strong vectors that visually merge with your subject can not only be distracting, they can be down right humorous. Again, reposition the camera or the subject to avoid mergers. ",Film Tip
Visual Composition rules,Rule of Thirds,"An offshoot of those artistic rules, used in still photography and video, is called the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds states that you should mentally divide the frame (what you see in the viewfinder) into thirds, both vertically and horizontally. What you get is like a tic-tac-toe board overlaying your screen. When you shoot your video, according to this rule, you should place your key subject elements along those lines. Where the lines intersect will be the best place for your subject. That means that centering your subject in the frame will create a less interesting composition.

In most cases you will have control over where you are with your camera. When framing your subject, move the camera so that the prominent subject elements fall along one of the third lines, preferably at a point where those lines intersect. If you can't move the camera to a good spot, try to move the subject (kind of tough if you're shooting a mountain!) 

A case in point would be the placement of the horizon line in an outdoor shot. Don't center the horizon on your screen. Place the horizon on either the top or bottom third line. Which one will depend upon your subject.  If you're shooting a sailboat on the ocean, do you want to show more of the ocean or more of the sky? That would be your artistic choice! Which one looks the best to you?

The point is to take control of the situation and try to frame the most appealing shot. Don't just accept whatever happens to appear in your viewfinder! ",Film Tip
Camera Movement,Arc,An arc shot is created by shooting while moving in a semicircle around your subject.  This shot has become common on TV dramas. You need to have good control of your camera to perform it smoothly.,Film Tip
Camera Movement,Following action,Don't try to follow action with the camera zoomed in. You'll quickly make you audience seasick.,Film Tip
Camera Movement,Pan,"A pan is the horizontal pivoting of the camera from a fixed point, left to right or right to left.  It is used to follow screen action or to reveal more of a location without zooming or repositioning the camera. It is a shot that is abused and overused by many beginning videographers. It might be used as an establishing shot, to follow a moving subject, or to reveal the relationship of one subject to another. A pan shot should have a beginning, middle, and end. Once started, a pan should continue smoothly in one direction, at the same rate of speed, until coming to a smooth stop on a well composed shot. Keep the camera recording as you hold it still at the end of your pan. You've chosen to lead your viewers to this shot by panning to it, so give them a chance to see what it is they were led to. You can always choose to cut the shot off when editing.  Generally speaking, don't string multiple pan shots together or pan one way and then back the other way. 

Pan tip #1: Move the camera slowly when panning. Most novices tend to pan much too fast.  The rate of your pan should match the pace of the scene you are shooting for. A very fast pan, often called a swish pan, can sometimes be used as a transition between scenes to signal a change of location and time.

Pan tip #2: Have a good reason for choosing to use a pan. Most of the time a pan can be replaced by multiple stationary shots with a more satisfying result.  Don't use pans because you are too lazy to shoot sequences!

Pan tip #3: Hold the camera still for a few seconds at the start of the pan as well as at the end. 

Pan tip #4: Practice the pan shot before recording it, making sure you know where to end the shot.  If you're going to be editing your footage you can always just record the shot again and use the best take for your edited program.",Edit Tip
Camera Movement,Pedestal,"A pedestal shot is the vertical or up and down movement of the camera, without changing the camera angle. ",Film Tip
Camera Movement,Tilt,"A tilt occurs when you pivot your camera up or down from a fixed position. As with the pan, a tilt should start and end with a stationary shot that is held for a few seconds. The same tips described in the pan section apply to tilts as well.",Film Tip
Camera Movement,Tracking - Dolly,"A dolly shot is performed by moving the camera toward or away from a subject. The effect can be vastly different than leaving the camera in a stationary position and zooming. A dolly shot has the effect of bringing your viewer closer to or farther away from the subject, while zooming reduces or magnifies the subject and the field of view.",Edit Tip
Camera Movement,Tracking - Trucking,"Tracking shots usually involve the use of some sort of wheeled camera support for smooth camera movement.  The pros will actually lay down a section of train-like tracks for the camera to be pushed along. If you don't have access to such equipment, you might try substituting a tripod on wheels (called a dolly) or you could have your camera person hold the camera while riding on an office chair, grocery cart, or wheelchair. It's generally best to use a wide-angle lens setting to keep camera shake to a minimum.

Tracking shots come in two basic varieties:

Trucking

Trucking is the lateral movement of the camera at right angles to the subject. It makes the background of the shot appear to move. Think of Fred Flintstone running through his cave house. The wall of his house appears to be moving as the camera appears to run along side Fred. Actually, since it's a cartoon, it is the drawing of the wall that is moving!  In real life, a trucking shot might be used to follow two people in conversation as they walk along a path. A trucking shot differs from a pan in that with a trucking shot, the camera changes location.  In a pan shot, the camera stays put and the direction it is pointed changes. 
The terms trucking and tracking are sometimes used interchangeably. ",Film Tip
Camera Movement,Zoom in for effect,"First off, let me point out that the zoom shot is probably the most overused shot of lazy or novice videographers.  Your video can improve dramatically by resisting the temptation to press the zoom toggle every time you want a different view.  You seldom see a zoom shot on television or at the movies. 

A zoom in can serve to concentrate the viewer's attention to particular subject or detail not evident in a wider shot. It is more dramatic than a cut from the wider shot to the zoomed in view, but takes longer. Have a good reason for making your audience wait.",Edit Tip
Camera Movement,Zoom out for effect,"A zoom out can serve to reveal the location or context of the thing that is framed at the start of the zoom.  Picture this. A shirtless young man sporting several facial piercings is sitting in a room with twenty other people. The camera slowly zooms out from a close-up of his face to reveal the other people in the room, who are all senior citizens in formal attire! ",Edit Tip
Horizon line,The horizon line,"Carpenters use levels to make sure the doorways they construct aren't leaning sideways and kitchen countertops don't slant to one side.  The world is full of vertical and horizontal lines. We expect vertical objects, like trees and the sides of buildings, to be at right angles to the ground.  We expect horizontal things, like where the ocean meets the sky (the horizon line) to be, well, horizontal! If you tilt your head to one side, the view or the world you get is an unnatural one. Things seem off kilter and a bit unsettling. That's the same effect you will have on your viewers if you compose shots where the horizon line is not parallel to the top and bottom of your frame.

Reaching for new horizons

However, if your goal is to create tension and add drama to a scene, tilting the camera sideways to created a slanted horizon would be a good way to do it. Combine a tilted camera with severe angles and your audience will start to become anxious. It generally works best to use extreme tilts.",Edit Tip
Horizon line,Tilting the camera,"If your goal is to create tension and add drama to a scene, tilting the camera sideways to created a slanted horizon would be a good way to do it. Combine a tilted camera with severe angles and your audience will start to become anxious. It generally works best to use extreme tilts.",Film Tip
Making Connections,Disappear effect,"If two consecutive shots are exactly the same, except objects within the frame are added or removed in the second shot, those objects will suddenly appear or disappear on the edited tape.  It's jump cut magic.  ",Edit Tip
Making Connections,Dissolve - Change location,"A dissolve is a gradual transition from one shot to the next, during which the two images overlap and blend.  A dissolve indicates a strong relationship between the images. A slow dissolve gives viewers time to consider that relationship and provides the smoothest transition. 

A dissolve can be used to indicate a change of location.  It can also indicate the passage of time, or a change of location and time.",Edit Tip

A dissolve can be used to indicate a change of location.  It can also indicate the passage of time, or a change of location and time.",Edit Tip
Making Connections,Jump cuts,"Cuts bridging images that don't have a logical connection or images that don't follow a logical order, will be jump cuts.  Jump cuts do not make sense to the viewer.  They call immediate attention to themselves.  Jump cuts break the flow of action and have a disorienting 'what the heck just happened?' effect on your audience.  

Jump cuts are also created when editing together two shots that are just slightly different in framing or angle. The resulting edit makes the subject appear to suddenly jump to a new position on the screen. Make sure that consecutive shots of the same subject are substantially different in field of view (like a MS to a CU) and/or are substantially different in angle (like flat shot to a high angle shot).",Edit Tip
Making Connections,The action line,"Another way jump cuts can happen is if you break the 180° rule by crossing the action line when shooting. Let's say you and a friend are shooting video at a basketball game. You set up your camcorder on the south side of the gym at mid court.  Your friend sets up at mid court on the north side. You both record a player driving for the basket on a fast break.  Later, when editing, you cut together the start of the play from your tape and the end of the play from your friend's tape.  The result will be a jump cut, as the player seemingly reverses direction in mid drive.  See also 'screen direction '",Edit Tip
Perspective,Converse between 2 people,An over the shoulder shot (OTS) is a type of POV shot.  It is often used when it is impractical for the camera to be in the same position as the person whose point of view you are showing. It's also used a lot when depicting a conversation between two people.,Film Tip
Perspective,Flat shot,A flat shot is a shot where the subject and the camera are at the same level. There is little emotional impact. This might be a shot of another person taken from their eye level.,Film Tip
Perspective,High angle shot,A high angle shot occurs when the camera is raised to a position higher than the subject. A slight difference makes the viewer feel somewhat superior to the subject. Raise the camera to a more extreme high angle and the viewer becomes clearly dominant. Frame a close-up shot of a person from an extreme high angle and the viewer becomes a threatening monster!,Film Tip
Perspective,Low angle shot,"A low angle shot occurs when the camera is lowered to a position below the height of the subject. This can make the subject appear larger than life, exaggerating its importance. There's a reason why the King and Queen have their thrones on a raised platform. It's the same reason professional wrestlers and football players are often photographed from a low angle. ",Film Tip
Perspective,Over the shoulder shot,An over the shoulder shot (OTS) is a type of POV shot.  It is often used when it is impractical for the camera to be in the same position as the person whose point of view you are showing. It's also used a lot when depicting a conversation between two people.,Film Tip
Perspective,Point of view,"The first motion pictures were really nothing more than stage plays that were filmed from a fixed position in the back of the theater. The Point of view was that of somebody in the audience, and it never changed. Directors slowly discovered that changing the point of view, by repositioning the camera to show things from the perspective of the actors, added a whole new dimension of interest to their films. Of course it required the film to be edited, which also opened up new worlds of creative opportunity!

Like those motion picture pioneers, beginning videographers often shoot only from the perspective of an observer. That can become very boring, and makes every shot appear flat. It's often refreshing to place your audience in the middle of the action, putting your camera in the position of the eyes of the people you're shooting.  Show your viewers the world as the participants in your video see it, and you'll add instant interest to your scene. Start mixing in some POV shots!

The movie Raising Arizona makes extensive use of POV shots. In one scene, Nicolas Cage's character is attempting to coral a room full of toddlers in diapers. The camera provides numerous shots from the point of view of the babies, as they look up at Cage (low angle shot) and he looks down at them (high angle shot). It travels close to the floor, providing viewers with a 'baby's eye view' as he crawls across the carpet (tracking shot). The camera provides a floor-level, side view, as it travels along side another crawling toddler (trucking shot). The use of POV shots makes the scene thoroughly engaging. Buy or rent the video for many, many more visual treats and ideas for creative shots.",Edit Tip
Perspective,Reaction shot,"Showing a subject's reaction to something that just occurred in your scene is aptly called a reaction shot. This shot conveys the impact of the moment. In a fictional story, it can be used to give your audience insight into what a character is thinking. Common reaction shots are close-ups of faces that portray alarm, delight, fear, laughter, suspicion . . . . . . whatever the moment calls for. Reaction shots are usually cutaways from the primary action, shown from the point of view of someone viewing the occurrence. When you're watching a televised performance of a comedian, and the view suddenly switches from the comedian to a close-up of somebody laughing at the last joke, that's a reaction shot. If you don't want to miss any of the main action, try to record reaction shots before or after the main event. You can edit these into the production later, wherever they would be appropriate to the action.",Edit Tip
Placement,Creative camera placement,"Today's small camcorders can fit into spaces that the camera operator can't. You could create a shot from inside a locker of somebody opening the door. The same could be done from inside the refrigerator as your subject opens the door and reaches for a soda (a quick trip to the fridge won't hurt the camera, but don't leave it in very long). The mailbox is another place. Make sure you zoom out to a wide-angle shot before positioning the camera.",Film Tip
Screen depth,Depth of field,"Depth of field refers to the range of objects that are in focus at the same time, from your camera lens to the farthest object in the distance. To borrow from geometry, you could say every shot has an y axis (horizontal line, screen left to screen right) and a x axis (vertical line, bottom of screen to top of screen). Depth of field would fall on a third axis, the z axis.  This is a line extending out from the camera lens into the distance.

A shot with a great, or wide depth of field, will have objects in both the foreground and background in simultaneous focus. One with a narrow, or shallow depth of field will have either background or foreground objects out of focus. Controlling focus along the z axis gives you some useful creative control.  ",Film Tip
Screen depth,Focus control,"You can control what your viewers concentrate on by controlling what part of your scene is in focus. A distracting background or foreground object can be obscured by placing it out of focus. You'll probably need to switch to manual focus to achieve this effect. 

Your ability to selectively focus on objects will depend upon your lens setting, your distance from the subject, and the distance between the subject and the background. 

In most cases you'll need to narrow the angle of view by zooming in. Regardless of lens setting, screen depth is always greatest when focused on the background. Focusing on the foreground creates a shallower depth of field, helpful in putting the background out of focus. The closer the foreground object is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field.  You'll also find that it is more difficult to achieve screen depth in low light situations.

You'll most likely need to zoom out to a wide angle setting if you want to keep objects in motion in focus at all times. ",Edit Tip
Screen depth,Foregrounds and backgrounds,"Making sure there are objects in both the foreground and background of your shot (and possibly points in between) can also establish screen depth. Again, wide angles lens settings are the best for this (see depth of field). Televised football games often will feature a ground level shot of the field with a football in the immediate foreground, seemingly almost touching the lens. Since everyone knows the relative size of a football, the goal post in the background at the far end of the field seems indeed very far away. They use an extreme wide-angle lens for that shot, which helps keep both the football and the far goal post in focus.",Edit Tip
Screen depth,Framing to add depth,"A simple way to give a shot a feeling of depth is to show perspective by framing your shot so your subject is at an angle. Instead of shooting a side view of your car, choose a corner of the car (say left front) and shoot facing that part of the car. This will create a foreground and a background, which is what you need to show depth. Use this technique on other things, like buses, buildings, bridges, etc. Using a wide-angle lens setting will help with this trick. (See Depth of field)",Film Tip
Screen depth,Movement aligning Z axis,"Movement toward and away from the camera, along the z axis, has a stronger impact than movement across the frame on the x axis. Shooting with a wide angle lens setting will expand the depth of field and keep your subject in focus. An added bonus is that you won't have to move the camera to keep the action in your frame.",Film Tip
Screen depth,Rack focus,"A rack focus shot is achieved by shifting focus during a shot in progress, typically between the foreground and background. You'll need to switch to manual focus to accomplish this shot.  You can use this technique to quickly shift the viewer's attention between something (someone) in the foreground and something (or someone) in the background. ",Film Tip
Screen depth,Visual compressions,"Choosing a lens setting with a narrow angle of view (zoomed in) creates a narrow depth of field and tends to visually compress the distance between objects in your shot along the z axis.  You could use this effect to make a group of people seem more crowded together than they actually are, or make a line of cars seem bumper to bumper.",Edit Tip
